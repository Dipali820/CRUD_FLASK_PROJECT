# CRUD_FLASK_PROJECT


This is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) web application built using Flask, a lightweight web framework for Python. The project demonstrates how to manage user data using a structured approach that includes routing, templates, and database models.

The application allows users to perform basic operations like adding, viewing, editing, and deleting entries in a user-friendly web interface. It uses HTML templates (with optional Bootstrap styling) for the frontend and SQLite (via SQLAlchemy) for database management.

This project is ideal for students and beginners who want to understand how a full-stack web app works using Python and Flask.
